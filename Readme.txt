Problem Statement: Open Innovation

1. The Project has 4 Files:
	i. Readme (.txt) getting started
       ii. satellite_orbit (.csv) Dataset
      iii. satellite_predection (.ipynb) Jupyter source file [CODE FILE]
       iv. Aryan_pandya_satellite_prediction (.ppt)


2. The presentation file contains the idea, understanding and implimentation of the project.

3. The concept used here is just the first step towards Solving problems, there are many works to be done on it.

4. There is Jupyter Source file, which contains Code as well as explaination of code in the comment itself.

5. Built over Visual Studio Code, one must need tools like: Visual Studio Code or Jupyter Notebook to Open/View/Edit the File.

6. The Dataset is downloaded from: https://celestrak.org/

7. I have rename the dataset for better understanding to: satellite_orbit
